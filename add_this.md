Long before any of you were born there was an amazing TV show called Knight Rider where the heroes, Michael Knight and his computer car KITT fought crime as the first officers of the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG).  Whether you have seen the show or not, you have probably seen the front of the car KITT, the iconic Trans Am.  

In this assignment you use your Arduino programming skills to make a string of six LEDs replicate KITT's lights seen in the gif above.

Here are the requirements:

Must use six LEDs of the same color (Since you do not yet have six of the same, if you are in class, just get six from your teacher.  If you are home, program and hook it up using different colors and get six of the same next Tuesday.)
Must use six 220 Ohm resistors.
Must use a for() loop in your code.
Submissions are due the next time you are in class and THIS IS EXTRA CREDIT - up to 30 points.

Good Luck.
